                <p class="submitAnswer_middle-question"><span>Question:</span> Installment Plan - Refund</p>
                <p class="submitAnswer_middle-text">I found out after settling a lawsuit that the $9,000 I 
                    would receive would be considered income. So I did not submit this 1099 on my 2019 taxes. 
                    I was notified that they received it (the IRS) and then they added it on to my taxes and 
                    I owe roughly $2,500. I set up an installment plan to pay for this over the next year. 
                    My question is; is that I show the IRS will owe me about a $9,000 refund this year - 
                    will they just take the $2,500 out of it or will they not give me a refund at all - 
                    what happens exactly? Thanks
